This catalog presents two code smells and two recommendations for composite refactorings to remove each code smell. These recommendations were found in empirical studies.

For each entry, we also present additional information that can be useful for recommendations of composite refactorings. There are concrete examples for each code smell, composite refactoring, and possible side effects of composite refactorings. This information was based on practice that we collected in our empirical studies.
